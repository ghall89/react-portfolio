## Description

A website to display some of my best work, tell the world a little bit about myself, and provide a means of contact.

The website itself is built with the UIKit framework to create a fully responsive layout, and provide standard UI elements. In addition, the home page is dynamically generated using the handlebars engine mainly as a demonstration of my knowledge of deploying a Node app, but also to make it easier to implement some ideas I have down the road.

The contact form logic is written in JavaScript, and used the EmailJS API as well as uses UIKit's notification library to provide on-screen user feedback.

If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
get its source. For example, if your program is a web application, its
interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
of the code. There are many ways you could offer source, and different
solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
specific requirements.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
